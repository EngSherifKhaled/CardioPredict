# CardioPredict: AI-Powered Heart Disease Risk Predictor
🔗 Live Demo: [CardioPredict Streamlit App](https://cardiopredictapp.streamlit.app)

CardioPredict leverages the UCI Heart Disease dataset to estimate the probability of heart disease in a patient. Explainable AI techniques are integrated to ensure model transparency and support clinical trust in predictions.

## Highlights
- Random Forest model achieving ~83% accuracy and 0.89 ROC-AUC
- SHAP-based global and patient-level explainability
- Interactive Streamlit demo handling missing inputs
- Fully reproducible ML workflow with preprocessing and deployment

## Project Overview
CardioPredict demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and explainability.  
It is designed for demonstration and portfolio purposes, emphasizing reproducibility and interpretability in healthcare ML.

## Dataset
- Source: [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) (303 samples, 14 features + target)
- Target: `0` = no heart disease, `1` = heart disease present
- Features include numeric (`age`, `trestbps`, `chol`, `thalch`, `oldpeak`) and categorical (`sex`, `cp`, `fbs`, `restecg`, `exang`, `slope`, `ca`, `thal`)
- Missing or implausible values handled during preprocessing
- Categorical variables encoded (binary directly, multi-class via pipeline)

## Modeling Approach
- Models evaluated: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Hyperparameter tuning applied for Random Forest and XGBoost using GridSearchCV
- Final model: Random Forest
  - Accuracy: ~83%
  - ROC AUC: ~0.89
- Stratified train-test split and cross-validation ensure robust generalization

---

## Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Numerical features standardized; outliers capped at 99th percentile
- Skewed features (oldpeak) square-root transformed
- Irrelevant or low-importance features dropped (`id`, dataset identifiers, negligible features)
- Pipeline ensures reproducibility and prevents data leakage

---

## Explainability
- Random Forest feature importance highlights top predictors
- SHAP summary plots provide global interpretability
- SHAP waterfall plots explain patient-level predictions
- Supports transparency and trust for healthcare applications

---

## Inference-Time Handling
- Missing numeric and categorical inputs handled using median/mode imputation derived from training data
- Clinical variables are **not inferred** from other features, avoiding compounded uncertainty
- Users are informed of any missing data used in predictions

---

## Results
- Confusion matrix and ROC curve show strong classification performance
- Key predictors: Age, chest pain type (`cp`), maximum heart rate achieved (`thalch`)
- SHAP plots highlight patient-level risk factors

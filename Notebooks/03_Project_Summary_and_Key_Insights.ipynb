Dataset\n","\n","* **Source:** UCI Heart Disease dataset\n","* **Samples:** 303\n","* **Features:** 14 features + binary target\n","* **Target:** 0 = no heart disease, 1 = heart disease present\n","* **Preprocessing Notes:** Missing or implausible values addressed (trestbps, chol, thalch); categorical variables encoded (binary directly, multi-class via pipeline)\n","\n","## 2. Data Preprocessing\n","\n","* Numerical features standardized using training data statistics\n","* Extreme outliers capped at the 99th percentile for model stability\n","* Right-skewed features (e.g., `oldpeak`) transformed using square-root scaling\n","* Low-relevance or redundant columns removed\n","* End-to-end pipeline prevents data leakage and ensures reproducibility\n","\n","## 3. Modeling\n","\n","* Models evaluated: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost\n","* Stratified train-test split and cross-validation applied for generalization assessment\n","* Hyperparameter tuning via `GridSearchCV` for Random Forest and XGBoost\n","* **Final Model:** Random Forest, chosen for balanced performance across accuracy, recall, and F1-score\n","\n","## 4. Feature Importance & Explainability\n","\n","* Feature importances identify globally influential predictors\n","* SHAP summary plots provide global interpretability and direction of feature impact\n","* SHAP waterfall plots explain individual patient predictions\n","\n","## 5. Evaluation\n","\n","* **Random Forest Performance:**\n","\n","  * Accuracy ≈ 83%\n","  * ROC AUC ≈ 0.89\n","* Confusion matrix shows strong sensitivity for disease-positive cases\n","* ROC curve confirms good class separation\n","* Model achieves strong predictive performance while maintaining interpretability\n","\n","## 6. Key Insights\n","\n","* Age, chest pain type (`cp`), and maximum heart rate (`thalch`) are strongest predictors\n","* Extreme cholesterol and resting blood pressure values capped for robustness\n","* SHAP explanations support transparency and clinical interpretability\n","* Pipeline-based design ensures reproducibility and deployment readiness\n","\n","## 7. Inference-Time Handling\n","\n","* Missing patient inputs handled using median (numeric) / mode (categorical) from training data\n","* Clinical variables are **not** inferred from other features, avoiding compounded uncertainty\n","\n","## 8. Next Steps\n","\n","1. **Finalize Model Artifacts:**\n","\n","   * Ensure `rf_pipeline.pkl` and `impute_values.pkl` are saved and versioned\n","   * Confirm all modeling plots are stored in Drive\n","2. **Documentation & Reporting:**\n","\n","   * Refine Step 19 summary in notebook\n","   * Update README.md with modeling, results, and inference-time handling\n","3. **Demo / Presentation Layer (Optional):**\n","\n","   * Build a minimal Streamlit app:\n","\n","     * Input sliders/dropdowns with \"Unknown\" option\n","     * Output: predicted probability, class, and risk bar\n","     * Optional: SHAP waterfall for individual patient explanation\n","4. **Reproducibility & Packaging:**\n","\n","   * Clean folder structure\n","   * Add `requirements.txt`\n","   * Ensure end-to-end reproducibility\n","5. **Future Work / Optional Enhancements:**\n","\n","   * Validate on external datasets\n","   * Monitor predictions for drift\n","   * Explore ensemble strategies only if they meaningfully improve performance\n"],"metadata":{"id":"4UXYqJmnpREZ"}}]}

    "## 1. Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Source:** UCI Heart Disease dataset\n",
    "* **Samples:** 303\n",
    "* **Features:** 14 features + binary target\n",
    "* **Target:** 0 = no heart disease, 1 = heart disease present\n",
    "* **Preprocessing Notes:** Missing or implausible values addressed (trestbps, chol, thalch); categorical variables encoded (binary directly, multi-class via pipeline)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "* Numerical features standardized using training data statistics\n",
    "* Extreme outliers capped at the 99th percentile for model stability\n",
    "* Right-skewed features (e.g., `oldpeak`) transformed using square-root scaling\n",
    "* Low-relevance or redundant columns removed\n",
    "* End-to-end pipeline prevents data leakage and ensures reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "* Models evaluated: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost\n",
    "* Stratified train-test split and cross-validation applied for generalization assessment\n",
    "* Hyperparameter tuning via `GridSearchCV` for Random Forest and XGBoost\n",
    "* **Final Model:** Random Forest, chosen for balanced performance across accuracy, recall, and F1-score\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Feature Importance & Explainability\n",
    "\n",
    "* Feature importances identify globally influential predictors\n",
    "* SHAP summary plots provide global interpretability and direction of feature impact\n",
    "* SHAP waterfall plots explain individual patient predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Random Forest Performance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Accuracy ≈ 83%\n",
    "  * ROC AUC ≈ 0.89\n",
    "* Confusion matrix shows strong sensitivity for disease-positive cases\n",
    "* ROC curve confirms good class separation\n",
    "* Model achieves strong predictive performance while maintaining interpretability\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "* Age, chest pain type (`cp`), and maximum heart rate (`thalch`) are strongest predictors\n",
    "* Extreme cholesterol and resting blood pressure values capped for robustness\n",
    "* SHAP explanations support transparency and clinical interpretability\n",
    "* Pipeline-based design ensures reproducibility and deployment readiness\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Inference-Time Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "* Missing patient inputs handled using median (numeric) / mode (categorical) from training data\n",
    "* Clinical variables are **not** inferred from other features, avoiding compounded uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Streamlit Demo Enhancements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Thoroughly test app with edge cases\n",
    "   * Optionally add SHAP waterfall explanations for individual predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Future Work:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Validate on external datasets\n",
    "   * Monitor predictions for drift\n",
    "\n"
